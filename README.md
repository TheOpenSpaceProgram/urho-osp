Build instructions can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheOpenSpaceProgram/urho-osp/wiki/Building-from-Source).

### Working Features
 * Loading resources from files
   * Parts use glTF format (.sturdy.gltf)
   * Functionality can be added to parts (Rocket that apply thrust)
   * Can be created directly in Blender
 * Assembling spacecraft from these parts
   * Parts are dragged together into a single rigid body that has physics
 * Piloting spacecraft
   * Rockets with throttle and instantaneous torque control
   * Spacecraft can reach orbit (uses physics engine)
 * Large universe
   * Coordinate system can reach 400Ã— the distance to Alpha Centauri
   * Multiple areas can have active physics (capable, but not used yet)
   * Floating Origin
 * Planet Level of Detail
   * Subdivides an Icosahedron
   * Generating chunks for a solid surface
   * Logarithmic Depth Buffer (disabled)
   * Doesn't kill the computer and runs smoothly on a chromebook

Features listed are not 100% complete, but work.

### Currently in Progress

 * A real way to build spacecraft (known as entities in the codebase)
   * Better Interface for the construction scene
   * Different kinds of structural attachments for parts
   * Proper data structure for entities
